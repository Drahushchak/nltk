in number nine - how can you distinguish names of organizations? I can pull out those phrases that have multiple capitalized words. But that seems shaky at best. How do you distinguish organization names from proper nouns more generally?

14. question about dot notation does it always rewrite the thing it's called upon?
16. question re: what's imported when you pull in a module

22 - just in general

explain what nltk.Index is? I get that it is basically the same thing as defaultdict(list). but can i just get an example of how the syntax would work?

can we just go over the last bit of 11? The part where it asks you to experiment with the parameters for the affix tagger? I get it conceptually, but practically I'm not quite sure what would be a best practice for working with them

16 - the sample code they give (code_baseline_tagger keeps getting an error saying that nltk is not found, even though it's already imported. i tried adding it in several different places. a scoping issue?)

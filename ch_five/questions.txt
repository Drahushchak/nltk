After August 12 meeting

32 - having problems getting the brill tagger to work. can we review its documentation and whatnot. I have it SORT of functioning. but not really. could we just get one up and running? I get the idea behind them, but i need to play around with them. Just helping me work through the process of training one with some rules would help. what is the syntax for the rules? The problem i'm having is that they changed their api for the brill tagger a lot, and the nltk book seems incorrect now.

35 - the answer to their question is yes, but not very well. Because really you'd need a context of n+2, because "must be" or "must have" could really be followed by a lot of different stuff. and you'd need to see where that third term was an adjective or a noun

37 - can we work through 37 together?
